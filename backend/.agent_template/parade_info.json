After Rex passes by, a seemingly endless convoy of hand-decorated semi-trailer trucks rumble along the Uptown route, with thousands of riders tossing beads and baubles. The parades, which can include over 100 trailers ridden by families and small organizations, can go on for hours, bidding farewell to Mardi Gras. For many, the Zulu and Rex parades are the climax of Carnival, others search the neighborhoods for Mardi Gras Indians. But some celebrants find their way farther downriver to the Bywater and Marigny neighborhoods where hundreds of do-it-yourself costumers gather at select intersections like flocks of surrealistic peacocks preparing to migrate en masse into the French Quarter. The most spectacular of the many marching clubs is the Societe de Sainte Anne. The half-century-old costuming club was named for a mysterious 19th-century tomb that members discovered in St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 and is meant to be a throwback to the informal, 19th-century foot processions that preceded regimented float parades. To behold the spectacle, stake out a place on Royal Street at Franklin Avenue or Kerlerec Street and follow the crowd into the Vieux Carre. To distinguish St. Anne from other marching groups, look for glinting standards made from hula hoops strung with fluttering ribbons.", "website": "https://www.crescentcitytruckparade.com/about_us"}}
